# Competitor Intelligence Framework with Big Data Governance



## Introduction

This project was initiated to harness the power of web-crawled competitor data, utilizing sophisticated data warehousing and predictive analytics technologies to enhance our strategic decision-making capabilities. As a Big Data Product Manager, I led the development and implementation of a comprehensive data management framework that not only addressed data integrity but also supported advanced applications in competitive analysis and sales forecasting.

Our objectives: 

to create a robust data warehouse architecture capable of accommodating trillions of data points from competitor websites, to cleanse and maintain high data quality against anti-crawling measures, and to develop predictive models that accurately forecast daily sales.



## Achievement

- Data Governance: Successfully managed trillions of data points collected through web scraping from three competitor websites. Implemented robust data cleaning processes to tackle issues from anti-crawling mechanisms, maintaining data quality accuracy within 97%.

- Data Warehouse Architecture: Redesigned and scaled our Hadoop Hive data architecture, which included developing and implementing backup strategies that enhanced data repair efficiency by 30%.

- Sales Forecasting: Developed and deployed an ARMA model to forecast daily sales accurately, achieving an annual revenue prediction accuracy within 5%.

- Graph Search Service: Overhauled our Kafka-based CV service, improving the completeness of our data matching capabilities from 63% to 99%. I also integrated a Milvus vector database with ResNet models to boost the accuracy of our product matching feature from 78% to 83%.

## Technology Used

- Hadoop Hive: Utilized for scalable data warehousing solutions, supporting vast amounts of structured and semi-structured data.

- SQL and Kafka: Employed for data manipulation and real-time data processing to handle massive datasets efficiently.

- ARMA Model: Applied for predictive analytics to forecast sales trends based on historical data.
