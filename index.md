### Industry Projects at SHEIN


[Fashion Attributes Extraction for Trend Analysis and Enhance Application with CLIP and Reasoning Captcha](attributes_recognition.md)

This project was designed to leverage **Large Multimodal Models** like **GPT4 Gemini** to enhance our understanding and adaptation to fashion industry trends. By recognizing and categorizing fashion attributes from competitors' products using LLM and predicting trends with statistical model, alongside employing **CLIP** for product recall based on top search keywords, we aimed to refine our product operation strategies to better align with market demands.

Achieving average **90%+** accuracy in **40+** attributes type **500+** attributes lables recognition.
